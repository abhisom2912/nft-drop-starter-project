# Different Types of Request
As mentioned in the previous section, Router CrossTalk can be used to create cross-chain requests with multiple payloads and handle those payloads on their respective destination chain contracts. Users can also opt to receive acknowledgment of their requests on the source chain. Depending on the number of calls in a single cross-chain request as well as the users' preference to receive an acknowledgment, CrossTalk requests can be classified into four types:
- [Single Call without Acknowledgment](./different-types-of-requests/single-call-without-ack)
- [Single Call with Acknowledgment](./different-types-of-requests/single-call-with-ack)
- [Multiple Calls without Acknowledgment](./different-types-of-requests/multiple-calls-without-ack)
- [Multiple Calls with Acknowledgment](./different-types-of-requests/multiple-calls-with-ack)
