# Validator Overview

Welcome to the validator documentation for Router. Validators are nodes that participate in the security of a network and are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain.

Like other Cosmos-based chains, validators on the Router chain are expected to mine blocks in exchange for block rewards. However, validators on the Router chain are also tasked with another responsibility - running an orchestrator instance.

Before reading more about orchestrators, it is important to understand the <a href="../omnichain-framework/high-level-workflow" target="_blank">high-level workflow</a> of a cross-chain transaction enabled via the Router chain.
