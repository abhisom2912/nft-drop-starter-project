# Your First Contract
This section will provide a step-by-step guide for first-time users to compile and deploy their first CosmWasm contract on the Router chain.


## Step 1) Installing Prerequisites
If you haven't already, [kindly install the required tools/technologies to interact with the Router chain](../installing-prerequisites).


## Step 2) Setting up an Account
Before setting up an account to interact with the Router chain, verify that the devnet is live and the following links are working for you:

-   RPC Endpoint - <https://devnet-alpha.lcd.routerprotocol.com/>

-   REST Endpoint - <https://devnet-alpha.tm.routerprotocol.com>

-   Faucet - <https://devnet-faucet.routerprotocol.com/>

-   Block Explorer - <https://devnet-explorer.routerprotocol.com/>

<summary><b>Method 2: Via Router CLI</b></summary>

If you are more comfortable with CLI commands and you will be deploying contracts directly using the CLI, this method should be preferred. To set up a wallet, follow these steps:

**Step 1)** Set up a wallet address using the following command:
```bash
routerd keys add wallet
```

**Step 2)** After running this command, you'll be asked for a keyring passphrase. Use `12345678` as the passphrase.

After entering the passphrase, you should be shown the following response:
```bash
- name: wallet
  type: local
  address: router1ssd4ws47d0mz8vat6z4jzg69ezq8y6s6kkk25q
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/routerprotocol.routerchain.crypto.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"A7H6PeN9c+b7NY+/op3TWf44IEsa14vC70U9dFzSSYW6"}'
  mnemonic: ""

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.

It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

**Step 3)** Now, you can go to this [faucet](https://devnet-faucet.routerprotocol.com/) to get some devnet tokens on the address generated in the previous step.

**Step 4) [Optional]** Add this account to the [Router station](https://devnet-router-station.routerprotocol.com/) by clicking on "Add account" and entering your mnemonic.

## Step 3) Compiling an Optimized CosmWasm contract

In this section, we will download the code for a sample contract and compile it into an optimized wasm binary executable.

### Compiling the Contract Code

Let's download the repository in which we keep [`cw-contracts`](https://github.com/deus-labs/cw-contracts) and compile the existing code for a simple name service contract that mimics a name service marketplace.

First, clone the repo and try to build the wasm bundle:
```bash
# Download the repository
git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts
cd cw-contracts
git checkout main
cd contracts/nameservice

# compile the wasm contract
cargo wasm
```

A file - `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_nameservice.wasm` should be received as an output. This is a release build, but not stripped of all the unneeded code. To produce a much smaller version, you can run the following command, which tells the compiler to strip the unused parts of the code out:
```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```

### Unit Tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests:
```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo unit-test
```
After some compilation steps, you should see the following response:
```bash
running 15 tests
test tests::tests::proper_init_no_fees ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_register_insufficient_fees ... ok
test coin_helpers::test::assert_sent_sufficient_coin_works ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_register_wrong_fee_denom ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_register_already_taken_name ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_transfer_from_nonowner ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_transfer_insufficient_fees ... ok
test tests::tests::fails_on_transfer_non_existent ... ok
test tests::tests::proper_init_with_fees ... ok
test tests::tests::register_available_name_and_query_works ... ok
test tests::tests::register_available_name_fails_with_invalid_name ... ok
test tests::tests::returns_empty_on_query_unregistered_name ... ok
test tests::tests::register_available_name_and_query_works_with_fees ... ok
test tests::tests::transfer_works ... ok
test tests::tests::transfer_works_with_fees ... ok
test result: ok. 15 passed;  0 failed;  0 ignored;  0 measured;  0 filtered out;
```

### Optimized Compilation

To reduce gas costs, the binary size should be as small as possible. This will result in a less costly deployment and lower fees for every interaction. Luckily, there is tooling to help with this. You can **optimize production code** using the [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer). `rust-optimizer` produces reproducible builds of CosmWasm smart contracts. This means third parties can verify that the contract is actually the claimed code.

> **Warning:** You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed in order to run `rust-optimizer`.

Naviaget to the project root (`cw-contracts/contracts/nameservice`) and make sure your Docker is running before initiating the following command:

<details>
<summary>On Mac/Linux</summary>

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.6
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>On an arm64 Machine (e.g. Apple's M1, M2)</summary>

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer-arm64:0.12.6
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>On Windows 10</summary>

```bash
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/code `
  --mount type=volume,source="$("$(Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)")_cache",target=/code/target `
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry `
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.6e
```

</details>

Following this command, a new wasm binary will be created under the folder `artifacts`.

## Step 4) Deploying and Instantiating your Contract
Now that we have the wasm binary ready, we can deploy it to the devnet and start interacting. You can use the UI or the `routerd` Go CLI.

<summary><b>Method 1: Via the UI</b></summary>

### Deploying and Instantiating the Contract
**Step 1)** Go to the [Router station](https://devnet-router-station.routerprotocol.com/) and click on **Add contract**.

<center><img src={require('./img/deploying-a-contract/step-1.png').default} alt="Step 1" style={{width: 300, marginBottom: 12}}/></center>

**Step 2)** Choose the **From file** option and upload your `cw_nameservice.wasm`  file.

<center><img src={require('./img/deploying-a-contract/step-2.png').default} alt="Step 2" style={{width: 500, marginBottom: 12}}/></center>

**Step 3)** Add a label and the following instantiation message:
```bash
{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"router"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"router"}}
```

**Step 4)** Click on the **Upload and Instantiate** button.
<center><img src={require('./img/deploying-a-contract/step-4.png').default} alt="Step 4" style={{width: 300, marginBottom: 12}}/></center>

> **Warning:** Please do not cancel/refresh while the contract gets deployed and instantiated.

### Instantiating an Already Deployed Contract
**Step 1)** Go to the [Router station](https://devnet-router-station.routerprotocol.com/) and click on **Add contract**.

**Step 2)** Choose the **From code** option and add your contract Code Id.
<center><img src={require('./img/instantiating-a-contract/step-2.png').default} alt="Step 2" style={{width: 500, marginBottom: 12}}/></center>

**Step 3)** Add a label and your instantiation message and click on the **Instantiate** button.
<center><img src={require('./img/instantiating-a-contract/step-3.png').default} alt="Step 3" style={{width: 300, marginBottom: 12}}/></center>

Following this step, your newly instantiated contract will be visible under the **Contracts** section.

<summary><b>Method 2: Via Router CLI</b></summary>

### Part 1 - Deploying the Contract

**Step 1)** Store the bytecode on the Router chain and acquire the Code Id. The Code Id will later be used to create an instance of the cw_namespace contract.

```bash
RES=$(routerd tx wasm store cw_nameservice.wasm --from wallet --node https://devnet-alpha.tm.routerprotocol.com:443 --chain-id router-1 --gas-prices 225000router --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --output json -b block)
# The response contains the Code Id of the uploaded wasm binary.
echo  $RES
```

**Step 2)** Check the list of contracts instantiated using the Code Id above.

```bash
routerd query wasm list-contract-by-code <your-code-id> --node https://devnet-alpha.tm.routerprotocol.com:443 --output json
```

The response should be an empty list, as we have not instantiated any contract yet:
```bash
{"contracts":[],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"0"}}
```

**Step 3)** Before we instantiate a contract with the Code Id and interact with it, let us check if the code stored on the blockchain is indeed the cw_namespace.wasm binary we uploaded.
```bash
# Download the wasm binary from the chain and compare it to the original one
routerd query wasm code <your-code-id> --node https://devnet-alpha.tm.routerprotocol.com:443 download.wasm
# The two binaries should be identical (first change directory to go the to the folder which has the cw_nameservice.wasm file, then run the following command)
diff cw_nameservice.wasm download.wasm
```

---

### Part 2 - Instantiating the Contract

**Step 1)** Prepare the instantiation message

```bash
INIT='{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"router"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"router"}}'
```

**Step 2)** Instantiate the contract
```bash
NODE=(--node https://devnet-alpha.tm.routerprotocol.com:443)
TXFLAG=($NODE --chain-id router-1 --gas-prices 225000router --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3)
routerd tx wasm instantiate <your-code-id>  "$INIT" --from wallet --label "name service"  $TXFLAG -y --no-admin
```
**Step 3)** After running the aforementioned command, you'll be asked for a keyring passphrase. Use `12345678` as the passphrase.

Upon instantiation, the `cw_nameservice` contract will store the instantiation message data in the contract's storage with the storage key **config**.
