# Introduction

The guides on this page will provide the list of infrastructure available when building with Router.

| **Infra** | **Purpose** |	**Users** |
| -------- | -------- |  -------- |
| **Router Scan** | Similar to any other chain explorer, this tool can be used for viewing the transactions, blocks, inbound and outbound requests and crosstalk requests, happening on Router Chain. <br /> Users can also view the validators data here - in terms of the stakes they have, uptime etc. | a. **dApps using Router chain for their cross-chain dApp**: to view their cross-chain transactions (inbounds/outbounds/crosstalk) and the status for these. <br />b. **Projects using Router as L1 chain:** to view their transactions on Router chain. <br />c. **End users using Router chain:** users using a dApp deployed on Router chain will use the explorer to view their transactions and itâ€™s status.|
| **Router Station** | Instantiate your contracts on Router chain, execute certain transactions from the contract, upgrade the contracts. | **Developers** using Router chain as L1 or using middleware capabilities for routing - this tool will be useful for them to interact with their contracts on Router chain. |
| **Router Robot** | RouterRobot is a cross chain integration testing Framework for end to end testing, behavior driven development (BDD) and robotic process automation (RPA). | **Developers** building cross-chain dApps using Router chain will use this tool for their testing requirements. |
| **Relayer** | Relayers can trustlessly relay outbound transaction to destination chain. | a. **dApps** can run their own application specific relayers to process their outbound transactions. <br /> b. Any user who want to run a trustless relayer for Router chain's outbound requests and earn the relayer fees for each transaction committed on destination chain.|
