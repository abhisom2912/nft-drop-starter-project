# Overview
What is Router Robot?
 
---
RouterRobot is a cross-chain integration testing framework for end-to-end testing, behavior-driven development (BDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries and tools that are developed to ease e2e testing of cross-chain applications built on the Router chain.

### Why Router Robot?

-   Enables easy-to-use tabular syntax for [creating test cases](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-cases) in a uniform way.

-   Provides ability to create reusable [higher-level keywords](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-user-keywords) from existing keywords.

-   Provides easy-to-read result [reports](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#report-file) and [logs](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#log-file) in HTML format.

-   Is platform and application independent.

-   Provides a simple [library API](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-libraries) for creating customized test libraries that can be implemented natively with Python.

-   Provides a [command line interface](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#executing-test-cases-1) and XML-based [output files](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#output-file) for integration into existing build infrastructure (continuous integration systems).

-   Provides support for testing web applications, rest APIs, mobile applications, running processes, connecting to remote systems via Telnet or SSH, and so on.

-   Supports creating [data-driven test cases](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#data-driven-style).

-   Has built-in support for [variables](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#variables), practical, particularly for testing in different environments.

-   Provides [tagging](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#tagging-test-cases) to categorize and [select test cases](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#selecting-test-cases) to be executed.

-   Enables easy integration with source control: [test suites](http://robot-framework.readthedocs.org/en/master/autodoc/robot.running.html#robot.running.model.TestSuite) are just files and directories that can be versioned with the production code.

-   Provides [test-case](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-setup-and-teardown) and [test-suite-level](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#suite-setup-and-teardown) setup and teardown.
