## Overview

The Router explorer provides information on the blocks, validator, network status, and various types of transactions happening on Router chain. We have provided an easy way using GraphQL to query the Router chain’s explorer data so that developers and applications can use the data as per their requirements for analytics or creating their own custom explorer.

## API Endpoints

Here all requests are READ ONLY. As of now there are no updates on DB available using these APIs. There are multiple endpoints provided, which can be used to get the desired data.

Explorer DB’s data can be queried with the GraphQL endpoints as given below. For application specific use cases refer [Application specific explorer](./application-specific-explorer.md) 

Incase of a requirement to directly use the functions to get data rather than query, [sdk-ts](https://www.notion.so/sdk-ts-5b50c9f129f74a9da6747722c9e4585e) can be used. The SDK has all the necessary function to query data from the explorer DB.
