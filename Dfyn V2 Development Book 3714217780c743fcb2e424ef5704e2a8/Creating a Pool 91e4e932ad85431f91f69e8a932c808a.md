# Creating a Pool

The pool deployment process start at the  MasterDeployer  Contract

    function protocolFee() external view returns (uint256, uint256);
}
```

Since we can have multiple type of pools, where each type has its own unique factory MasterDeployer Contract is used to deploy pools.
For now weâ€™ll be deploying Concentrated Liquidity Pool.

```solidity
function deployPool(address _factory, bytes calldata _deployData) external returns (address pool) {
      }
```

The **`deployPool`** function is used to deploy a new pool using a factory contract. The function takes two arguments: an **`address`** for the factory contract that will be used to deploy the pool, and **`bytes calldata`** for the deployment data that will be passed to the factory contract.

```solidity
 if (!whitelistedFactories[_factory]) revert NotWhitelisted();
```

Before deploying the pool, the function checks if the factory contract is on the whitelist by checking the **`whitelistedFactories`** mapping. If the factory contract is not on the whitelist, the function will revert with the **`NotWhitelisted`** error.

```solidity
pool = IPoolFactory(_factory).deployPool(_deployData);
pools[pool] = true;
emit DeployPool(_factory, pool, _deployData);
```

If the factory contract is on the whitelist, the function calls the **`deployPool`** function on the factory contract, passing in the deployment data as an argument. The address of the newly deployed pool is then stored in the **`pools`** mapping and an event is emitted to indicate that a new pool has been deployed. The function returns the address of the newly deployed pool.

### ConcentratedLiquidityPoolFactory.sol :

Lets take a look at the  **`deployPool`** function on the factory contract.

```solidity
function deployPool(bytes memory _deployData) external returns (address pool) {
        address[] memory tokens;

        (address tokenA, address tokenB, uint160 price, uint24 tickSpacing) = abi.decode(_deployData, (address, address, uint160, uint24));

        // Revert instead of switching tokens and inverting price.
        if (tokenA > tokenB) revert WrongTokenOrder();

        // Strips any extra data.
        // Don't include price in _deployData to enable predictable address calculation.
        _deployData = abi.encode(tokenA, tokenB, tickSpacing);
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encode(tokenA, tokenB));
        tokens = new address[](2);
        tokens[0] = tokenA;
        tokens[1] = tokenB;
        (pool) = ConcentratedPoolDeployer(deployer).deployConcentratedPool(salt);
        _registerPool(pool, tokens, keccak256(_deployData));
        IConcentratedLiquidityPool(pool).initialize(_deployData, masterDeployer, limitOrderManager);
        IConcentratedLiquidityPool(pool).setPrice(price);
        IConcentratedLiquidityPool(pool).updateSwapFee(MIN_SWAP_FEE);
        IConcentratedLiquidityPool(pool).updateProtocolFee();
    }

```

The **`deployPool`** function is used to deploy a new concentrated liquidity pool using the **`ConcentratedPoolDeployer`** contract. The function takes one argument: **`bytes memory`** for the deployment data that will be passed to the **`ConcentratedPoolDeployer`** contract.

The function begins by decoding the deployment data using the **`abi.decode`** function. The deployment data should contain the addresses of two tokens, a price, and a tick spacing. The function then checks if the tokens are in the correct order, and if not, it reverts with the **`WrongTokenOrder`** error.

Next, the function strips any extra data from the deployment data, and calculates a **`salt`** value by calling the **`keccak256`** function on the two token addresses. The function then deploys a new concentrated liquidity pool using the **`ConcentratedPoolDeployer`** contract, passing in the **`salt`** value as an argument. The address of the newly deployed pool is stored in the **`pool`** variable.

The function then registers the new pool by calling the **`_registerPool`** function, passing in the pool address, an array of the two token addresses, and the **`keccak256`** hash of the deployment data. The function then initializes the pool by calling the **`initialize`** function on the pool contract, passing in the deployment data, the address of the **`masterDeployer`**, and the address of the **`limitOrderManager`**. The function then sets the pool's price by calling the **`setPrice`** function, and sets the swap fee by calling the **`updateSwapFee`** function. Finally, the function updates the protocol fee by calling the **`updateProtocolFee`** function. The function returns the address of the newly deployed pool.

### ConcentratedPoolDeployer.sol

Lets take at the deployConcentratedPool function called by CLPFactory.

```solidity

    function deployConcentratedPool(bytes32 salt) external returns (address pool) {
        factory = msg.sender;
        pool = address(new ConcentratedLiquidityPool{salt: salt}());
    }
```

The **`deployConcentratedPool`** function is used to deploy a new concentrated liquidity pool contract. The function takes one argument: **`bytes32`** for the **`salt`** value that will be used to create a unique address for the pool contract.

The function begins by storing the caller's address in the **`factory`** variable. This will be the address of the factory contract that is calling this function. The function then creates a new instance of the **`ConcentratedLiquidityPool`** contract, passing in the **`salt`** value as an argument to the contract's constructor. The address of the newly deployed contract is stored in the **`pool`** variable, and the function returns this value
