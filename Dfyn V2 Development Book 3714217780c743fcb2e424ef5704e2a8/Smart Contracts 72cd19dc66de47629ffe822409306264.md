# Smart Contracts

The list of contracts contributing to the smooth running of Dfyn V2

### Master Deployer

The contract has several functions that allow the owner to deploy pools, add and remove factories from a whitelist, and update fees. The contract also includes events that are emitted when certain actions are taken, such as adding a factory to the whitelist or deploying a pool.

### ConcentratedLiquidityPool

The contract **ConcentratedLiquidityPool** is an implementation of a concentrated liquidity pool for the Dfyn protocol. It allows users to mint, burn, and swap tokens within the pool while tracking the coordinates of upper and lower price boundaries using ticks. The contract also handles the creation and management of limit orders. It imports several libraries to assist with calculations and validations, as well as a number of interfaces for interacting with other contracts in the Dfyn protocol.

### ConcentratedLiquidityPoolFactory

The **ConcentratedLiquidityPoolFactory ``**contract is a factory contract that is used to deploy **ConcentratedLiquidityPool** contracts with specific configurations. The contract allows the owner to set the deployer address and update the swap fee for a given pool.

### ConcentratedLiquidityPoolHelper

The **ConcentratedLiquidityPoolHelper** contract is a periphery contract for reading state information from a concentrated liquidity pool. It provides functions for reading the tick state, lower old and upper old values, and lower old and upper old limit values. This contract is useful for reading information from the concentrated liquidity pool without interacting with it directly.

### ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager

The **ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager** contract is a periphery contract for the Dfyn concentrated liquidity pool. It combines non-fungible position management and staking and provides functions for minting and redeeming positions, calculating pool rewards, and updating the staked position. This contract is used to manage and track positions in the concentrated liquidity pool and to facilitate staking and rewards for pool participants.

### ConcentratedPoolDeployer

This contract is used by the **ConcentratedLiquidityPoolFactory ``**to deploy new pools with the specified configurations.  It also return the poolâ€™s init code hash.

### LimitOrderManager

The **LimitOrderManager** contract is a contract for managing limit orders on the Dfyn exchange. It has functions for creating, claiming, and canceling limit orders. It also has an event for emitting when a new limit order is created, claimed, or canceled. 

This contract is used **IConcentratedLiquidityPool** interface to manage limit orders in a concentrated liquidity pool.

It uses a **LimitOrderToken** contract to mint non-fungible tokens for each limit order.

### LimitOrderToken

The contract has two functions: **mint** and **burn**. The **mint** function allows the contract's owner to mint new tokens by specifying the recipient and the token ID. The **burn** function allows the owner to burn existing tokens by specifying the token ID.

### Vault

This contract allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer ERC20 tokens. It also enables users to borrow tokens through a "flash loan" mechanism, which allows users to borrow a certain amount of tokens for a short period of time and then pay them back.

The contract maintains a balance for each user for each ERC20 token that they have deposited, and it uses a "rebase" mechanism to keep track of the total supply of each token. The contract also allows the owner to whitelist certain addresses, which allows those addresses to borrow tokens without paying a fee.
