# Dfyn V2 Mathematics

Mathematically, Dfyn V2 uses the same formulas as Dfyn V1, but they have been enhanced and augmented in comparison to V1.

## Liquidity Math:

To facilitate transitioning between price ranges, streamline liquidity management, and avoid rounding errors, Dfyn V2 introduces the following concepts:

$$
L = \sqrt{xy}
$$

The liquidity of a pool is determined by the product of two numbers, which represent the amount of token reserves in the pool. The/ measure of liquidity, represented by the variable $L$, is the square root of the product of these two numbers ($x$ and $y$). This means that $L$ is the geometric mean of $x$ and $y$, and when $L$ is multiplied by itself, the result is equal to the product of $x$ and $y$ $(k)$. This formula can be written as  $L =$ $\sqrt{xy}$ , where x and y are the token reserves and k is their product.

## Price Math:

$$
P = \sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}
$$

${y/x}$ is the price of token 0 in terms of 1. Since token prices in a pool are reciprocals of each other, we can use only one of them in calculations (and by convention DfynV2 uses $y/x$). 

The price of token 1 in terms of token 0 is simply.   $\frac{1}{y/x}=\frac{x}{y}$ 
Similarly,  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y/x}} = \sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}$

Why using $\sqrt{P}$ instead of P? There are two reasons:

1. Square root calculation is not precise and causes rounding errors. Thus, it’s easier to store the square root without calculating it in the contracts (we will not store $*x*$ and $*y*$ in the contracts).
- can accomodate larger prices by storing the price in square root form
1. $\sqrt{P}$ has an interesting connection to $L: L$ is also the relation between the change in output amount and the change in $\sqrt{P}.$

$$
L=ΔPΔy

$$

$$
Proof:
\\
\sqrt{xy}=\frac{y_1−y_0}{\sqrt{P_1}-\sqrt{P_0}}
\\
\sqrt{xy}({\sqrt{P_1}-\sqrt{P_0}})= {y_1−y_0}
\\
\sqrt{xy}(\sqrt{\frac{y_1}{x_1}}-\sqrt{\frac{y_0}{x_0}})={y_1−y_0}
\\
Since,\sqrt{x_0y_0}=\sqrt{x_1y_1}=\sqrt{xy}=L
\\
\sqrt{\frac{x_1y_1y_1}{x_1}}-\sqrt{\frac{x_0y_0y_0}{x_0}} = {y_1−y_0}
\\
\sqrt{y_1^2}-\sqrt{y_0^2} = {y_1−y_0}
\\
{y_1−y_0}={y_1−y_0}

$$

Again, we don’t need to calculate actual prices–we can calculate output amount right away. Also, since we’re not going to track and store $x$ **and $*y$* our calculation will be based only on $L$ and $\sqrt{P}$.
From the formula above we can calculate $Δy$.

$$
Δy = Δ\sqrt{P}L
$$

As we discussed above, prices in a pool are reciprocals of each other. Thus $Δx$ is:

$$
Δx = Δ\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}L
$$

$L$  and $\sqrt{P}$ allow us not to store and update any pool reserves. Also we don’t need to calculate $\sqrt{P}$  each time  because we can always find $Δ\sqrt{P}$ and its reciprocal.

## Tick Math:

As we learned in this chapter, the infinite price range of V1 is split into shorter price ranges in V2. Each of these shorter price ranges is limited by boundaries–upper and lower points. To track the coordinates of these boundaries, Dfyn V2 uses *ticks.*

![Untitled](Dfyn%20V2%20Mathematics%207457b80b62a84404ac15f6984c89c285/Untitled.png)

In Dfyn V2, the entire price range is demarcated by evenly distributed discrete ticks. Each tick has an index and corresponds to a certain price:

$$
p(i)=1.0001^i
$$

Where $p(i)$ corresponds to price at tick $(i)$. Taking powers of 1.0001 has a desirable property: the difference between two adjacent ticks is 0.01% or *1 basis point*.

> Basis point (1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001) is a unit of measure of percentages in traditional financial markets.
> 

As we discussed above, we never store $P$ in our contracts only $\sqrt{P}$ . Thus the above formula becomes:

$$
\sqrt{p(i)}=\sqrt{1.0001}^i={1.0001}^{\frac{1}{2}i}
$$

So when we iterate for values of $i$ we get the value as,

$$

\sqrt{p(0)} = 1p(0)​=1, \sqrt{p(1)} = \sqrt{1.0001} \approx 1.00005p(1)​=1.0001​≈1.00005, \sqrt{p(-1)} \approx 0.99995p(−1)​≈0.99995.
$$

Ticks are integers that can be positive and negative and, of course, they’re not infinite. 
Dfyn V2 stores $\sqrt{P}$ as a fixed point Q64.96 number, which is a rational number that uses 64 bits for the integer part and 96 bits for the fractional part. Thus, prices (equal to the square of $\sqrt{P}$ ).
are within the range : $[2^{128},2^{-128}]$. By this calculation the tick range will become: 

$$
[log1.0001​2−128,log1.0001​2128]=[−887272,887272]
$$
