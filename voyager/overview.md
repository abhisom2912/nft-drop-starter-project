## Background


## Motivation
Without a robust mechanism that promotes dynamic liquidity migration across various blockchains, there will be a cap on current as well as upcoming L1s/L2s achieving their full potential. Even with the progression of cross-chain bridges from just “asset transfer” tools to cross-chain communication frameworks, one of their most essential use-cases remains asset transfers across various chains. Cross-chain bridges can enable liquidity to flow seamlessly between blockchains and increase capital efficiency in the system. Such bridges can operate between two blockchains, between a blockchain and a side chain, or even between two side chains. With Voyager, we want to give users an efficient way to not just transfer, but swap assets across chains.

## About Voyager
Voyager is a cross-chain token transfer and swap platform that offers cross-chain token transfers as well as cross-chain sequencing of token transfer and arbitrary instructions. This can be useful for users who want to take advantage of the unique features and functionality of different blockchains, or who want to diversify their portfolio by holding assets on multiple chains.

Voyager allows users to move assets between blockchains without the need for a centralized exchange. It uses smart contracts to facilitate the transfer of assets between chains. This can be faster and more secure than using a centralized exchange, as there is no need to trust a third party with your assets.

It also allows users to perform operations after the transfer of tokens is executed on the destination chain without any external triggers. This opens up an ocean of possibilities for the emerging chain-agnostic future.
